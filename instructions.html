            <p>Welcome to my Harry Potter Trivia game. I am happy you came across my application the game is simple you
                have 20 seconds
                to answer each question. Once you pick a answer you
                will move on to
                the next question.If you cannot answer the question in 20 seconds it will skip to
                the next question in the trivia game. Good Luck Have fun and be sure to come back for the next update.
